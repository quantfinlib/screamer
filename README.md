Engineered in C++ and leveraging state-of-the-art numerical algorithms, Screamer delivers 
exceptional computational efficiency, consistently outperforming traditional libraries 
like NumPy and Pandasâ€”often by factors of two or more, and in some cases by orders of magnitude. 

Screamer's polymorphic design allows all functions to operate seamlessly on both static arrays
and streaming data, enabling smooth integration and consistent syntax without code modification. 
Built for secure, real-time analysis, Screamer's stream-processing approach ensures every 
function is free from look-ahead bias, guaranteeing accurate results you can trust.
